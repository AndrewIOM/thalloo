Fairtrade gold and development in Tanzania	"This paper offers a critical analysis of the most contemporary development intervention concerned with ameliorating the problems of Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM) in sub-Saharan Africa, namely the emergence of Fairtrade Gold. Through an analysis of Fairtrade Gold in Tanzania, this paper argues that despite Fairtrade's promises to ASM operators of better prices, its potential efficacy is compromised by the informality of local gold markets and a deeply-rooted mistrust of development intervention more broadly. However, its greatest contribution may lie elsewhere in the drive for a social and environmental justice framework that privileges increased recognition for small-scale gold miners in the global South.

We assessed the impact of certification by comparing the floristic composition of 52 taxa of trees and shrubs in the treefall gaps of certified, conventionally managed and protected forests in northern Honduras. The highest abundance of light-benefiting taxa was found in certified forests, whereas conventionally managed forests were floristically more similar to natural forests. The environmental conditions measured in certified gaps were not favourable for a natural forest floristic composition. Past logging may have altered the species composition in certified forests relatively more than in conventionally managed forests. This implies that the need for restoration operations should be considered in certification requirements, along with landscape-level planning to enhance post-logging recovery.

Forest Stewardship Council certification in Mexico	"Since its creation more than two decades ago as a voluntary market-based approach to improving forest management, forest certification has proliferated rapidly in developing countries. Yet we know little about whether and under what conditions it affects deforestation. We use rich forest management unit-level panel data - including information on deforestation, certification, regulatory permitting, and geophysical and socioeconomic land characteristics - along with matched fixed effects models to identify the effect of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification on deforestation in Mexico, the country with the third-highest number of FSC certifications in the developing world. We test for a variety of different temporal and subgroup effects but are unable to reject the null hypothesis that certification does not affect deforestation. Although these results do not indicate that FSC certification has no effect on forest management, they do suggest that its impact on deforestation may be limited."

We analyze the implications of different coffee certification schemes in Ethiopia using cross-sectional survey data, and regression and propensity-score-matching techniques. We find that: Rainforest Alliance (RA) and double Fairtrade-Organic (FT-Org) certifications are associated with higher incomes and reduced poverty, mainly because of higher prices; Fairtrade (FT) certification hardly affects welfare; and Organic (Org) certification reduces incomes, chiefly due to lower yields. Cooperative heterogeneity importantly shapes these results. Results imply that private standards may not always deliver what they promise to consumers."

Rainforest-Alliance certified banana production versus non-certified conventional banana production	"Export banana production in Latin America is pesticide intensive, receiving much negative publicity regarding human health problems and environmental degradation. The Rainforest Alliance (RA) certification scheme was established to certify farms that met a number of social, occupation health and environmental standards set by RA and their certifying body, the Sustainable Agriculture Network (SAN). This study was one of the first, independent studies of the environmental impact of some of the principles set by RA and SAN. The study focuses on insect and bird diversity as an indicator of ecosystem health. Five RA certified farms, six non-RA certified farms, and five organic certified farms were sampled. The data was analyzed with RDA multivariate analyses and Monte Carlo permutation tests. The results showed that RA certified farms had less insect diversity compared to non-RA certified farms and that both farm types had less insect diversity than organic farms. There was little difference between RA and non-RA certified farms with regards bird community composition. Thus, organic farming conserves biodiversity, while alternative environmental labels (e.g. a Rainforest alliance seal) may not have any visible positive effect on in-farm biodiversity. This study points to the need for improvements in SAN certification standards to achieve improved environmental conditions. Â© 2016 The Authors."

In 2013, 226 million metric tons were produced in over 70 countries. Organically produced soybean represents less than 0.1% of total world production. In the USA, the certified organic soybean crop was grown on 53 thousand ha or 0.17% of the total soybean acreage in the USA (32 million ha) in 2011. A gradual increase in production of organically grown soybean has occurred since the inception of organic labeling due to increased human consumption of soy products and increased demand for organic soybean meal to produce organic animal products. Production constraints caused by pathogens and insect pests are often similar in organic and non-organic soybean production, but management between the two systems often differs. In general, the non-organic, grain-type soybean crop are genetically modified higher-yielding cultivars, often with disease and pest resistance, and are grown with the use of synthetic pesticides. The higher value of organically produced soybean makes production of the crop an attractive option to some farmers. This article reviews production and uses of organically grown soybean in the USA, potential constraints to production caused by pathogens and insect pests, and management practices used to reduce the impact of these constraints.

D."	2017	The financial benefits of forest certification: Case studies of acacia growers and a furniture company in Central Vietnam	"The demand for forest products is growing and plantation forests are supplying an increasing proportion of wood to industry. There are also increasing market requirements to demonstrate the sustainability of timber supply. Vietnam has some 3.9 M ha of plantation forests, 44% of which is on short-rotations managed by smallholders. More than 80 percent of the harvested volume from the plantation forests is used for woodchip production to serve domestic and international markets. The Vietnam Government has goals to increase the domestic supply of suitable wood for furniture production to international markets by increasing the supply of larger logs grown in plantations and the supply of certified wood to industry. However, it is not clear that these objectives will necessarily benefit growers and processors. This study compared financial returns from certified and non-certified forest products for: (1) growers with 10-year rotation acacia plantations; and (2) a furniture processing business (battens for chair and table) in Quang Tri Province, Central Vietnam. The data were collected from smallholder tree growers and a sawmilling company, triangulated with and supplemented by formal and informal interviews with other stakeholders. Currently, much of the cost of certification is met by external aid donors. Results showed that net returns from both certified and non-certified timber products are positive for both actors and are higher from certified timber production than non-certified timber production. When the full costs of certification are included, the benefits to growers of certification are much reduced and potentially negative unless the fixed costs can be spread over a large group of growers. A minimum of group with 3000 ha may be required to make certification cost effective. In recent years, the price difference between the certified and non-certified logs is narrowing and this may discourage farmers from attaining certification. For the sawmiller, the benefit of certified timber production is greater. It would be in their interests to increase prices paid to growers for certified logs. Government policy measures to support certification should include consideration of who bears the cost, support for aggregation of smallholder growers and improved communication in timber supply chains.

Ten farm pairs, each of which consists of one organic and one conventional farm with less than 10 ha of fig plantation, were selected from five Fig Sales Cooperative (Taris-Incirbirlik) regions of Aydin Province with varying agro-ecological conditions. Although six of the organic farms matched or exceeded the production of their conventional counterparts, the three-year mean yield of the organic farms as a group was 5% lower than that of the conventional farms. However, excluding organic certification costs, mean variable costs and net income were similar for both groups, mainly because organic price premiums received by the farmers compensated for lower yields. If current organic certification costs paid by firms are included to farm budgets, the price premiums paid to organic producers would have to increase to 22% in order to equal the net incomes from conventional dried fig. Conventional farmers identified low and unstable prices as the main constraints for sustained production and stated further intensification of production as their main goal. Organic farmers focused on farm diversification and agronomic practices that permit organic farm management."

There is growing interest in certification across Central America and initiatives to define nationally-appropriate criteria and indicators are being established in many countries. It is clear that it is generally the most innovative forest owners who have become certified. For most, sustainability was already a key objective for their forest management so that the additional cost involved in becoming certified was marginal. The process of certification promoted by the Forest Stewardship Council is generally seen as a useful one, resulting in improvements to technical forest management, better relations with workers and with local authorities, and access to new markets. Nevertheless, the process is also criticised for being too dominated by Northern certification bodies with the quality of certification teams being variable from one place to another. The increasing competition between certification bodies raises questions about the potential conflict between running a business and maintaining consistent standards of certification. Other issues raised concern the perceived dominance of a Northern conservationist paradigm (both amongst NGOs and donors) which is seen to put environmental interests above business reality, is reluctant to assist private forest companies in becoming certified, and would prefer no operations in primary forest to be certified."

Rejuvenation strategies for cocoa presently coalesce either around improved varieties and greater use of agro-chemical inputs in full sun systems or eco-certification that requires trees to be integrated with cocoa. Here, we explore the possibility of uniting these approaches through building on current farmer practice of incorporating trees in their cocoa fields to improve cocoa productivity and diversify their livelihoods. We interviewed 355 farmers about trees integrated in their cocoa fields across four locations in the South-West of Câ„¢te dÃ•Ivoire in 2012, stratified by whether or not farmers were eco-certified. Despite the massive deforestation, a rich diversity of trees was found in cocoa fields and an overwhelming majority of farmers (95Ã_%) wanted more trees and/or more tree species, regardless of their certification status or ethnic origin. There was a consensus that most trees were compatible with cocoa, but farmers also traded off negative impacts of some species against their productive contribution to their livelihood. Farmers valued tree diversity on their cocoa plots and provided detailed information on how 32 tree species interacted with cocoa in terms of soil moisture retention, soil fertility improvement and pest and disease interactions but also had key gaps in knowledge about alternative hosts of mirids and mistletoe. The majority of farmers were not aware of the certification requirements for tree species and shade cover but a much higher proportion of certified farmers (76Ã_%) had received information about shade trees than non-certified farmersÃ_(15Ã_%), although advice only related to eight tree species. Scope for building on local knowledge and practice to sustainably increase cocoa productivity through promoting tree diversity while enhancing other ecosystem service provision was identified and the next steps required to realize this set out.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on research with four SFTEs in Bangladesh, taking an ethnographic approach with qualitative methodologies such as semi-structured interviews, recorded meetings, informal discussions, analysis of grey literature, and observation with managers, staff, field workers and artisans of the organisations. Findings - The meanings of Fair Trade are located in personal, family, business and national understandings of fairness and development. Such meanings inform the business practices of the SFTEs, used to achieve both commercial success and social goals, confirming the role of SFTEs in creating and maintaining ideals of fairer trade. Research limitations/implications - There is a need for more research on Fair Trade from the perspective of SFTEs. Practical implications - The research draws attention to the key roles and business practices of the SFTE, increasing the understanding of what happens in the name of Fair Trade, and also provides lessons for other socially responsible enterprises. Social implications - The research highlights the importance of Southern meanings and practices, which should be included in the conceptualisation of Fair Trade, thus facilitating both informed debate and understanding the possibilities for the promotion and extension of fairer trade. Originality/value - This research is unusual in concentrating on the central role played by the SFTE, particularly in the handicraft sector and with businesses rather than cooperatives. The business practices and decisions of SFTEs are often hidden in representations of Fair Trade."

The coffee sector is a prime example, where sustainability certification could improve livelihoods for poor smallholders. However, as individual production volumes are low, smallholder farmers need to cooperate in certification as a group, which makes impact assessment more complicated. Previous empirical studies, reporting premia of up to 30%, have neglected the costs associated with group certification. We explore the issue using an agent-based simulation of coffee producer organisations in Uganda, including the certification-related costs for farmers. Our results suggest that certification can have a small positive impact on participating households. But the added value of certification is substantially lower than the price premium, because of certification costs. Increasing both the membership of the producer groups and their deliveries of certified coffee are necessary to improve the rewards of certification.

Thus, producers and exporters of fresh fruit in developing countries like Brazil are increasingly required to demonstrate the safety and traceability of their produce up to the consumption stage. This paper aims at presenting a comparative analysis of the different certification schemes applied to fruit production in Brazil. A survey of 303 grape and mango farmers was conducted in 2006 in the Juazeiro and Petrolina regions of the Sâ€_o Francisco Valley. The results of the certification schemes adopted by grape farmers show that GlobalGAP certified ones have higher productivity. The income of farmers with one certificate is higher than that of those with two certificates.

The certification programs could be expected to promote forest conservation by providing a premium price to shade coffee producers. However, little is known about the significance of the conservation efforts generated by certification programs. In particular, the relationship between the impact of the certification and producer characteristics has yet to be examined. The purpose of this study, which was conducted in Ethiopia, was to examine the impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest conservation and its relationship with the socioeconomic characteristics of the producers. Remote sensing data of 2005 and 2010 was used to gauge the changes in forest area. Employing a probit model, we found that a forest coffee area being certified increased the probability of forest conservation by 19.3 percentage points relative to forest coffee areas lacking certification. We also found that although economically poor producers tended to engage in forest clearing, the forest coffee certification program had a significant impact on these producers. This result suggests that the certification program significantly affects the behaviors of economically poor producers and motivates these producers to conserve the forest. Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc."

Support was aimed at transforming Soppexcca into a viable business, able to respond to the needs of its coffee-farming members. Results show that Soppexcca made significant gains, including expansion of infrastructure, growth in membership, and increased financial stability. However, important issues remained, related to democratic governance, future growth and stability, and the provision of services. Results suggest that advances in building cooperatives do not easily translate into increased capacities at the household level. While some important gains were detected, in general, producers struggled to intensify coffee production and take full advantage of their access to preferential markets. This paper makes a plea for deeper discussions about how buyers and NGOs can more effectively contribute to building the supply of high-quality Fairtrade coffee, and the need for increased coordination and mutual learning as part of the process."

The purpose of this study is to analyze the functioning of different coffee supply chains in Bolivia and find policy changes necessary to sustain specialty coffee production in that country. Based on the primary and secondary data collected from various market functionaries, we find that the Bolivian coffee growers and other intermediaries have benefited financially from participating in fair trade and organic markets. However, the producers continue to face challenges, including increasing costs of production, stagnant premium, price floors, and declining yield. Institutional reforms within the supply chain and greater support from the government are necessary to ensure a better functioning Bolivian market. The government should also prioritize certified coffee as a part of its national food sovereignty agenda since Bolivians consume increasing amounts of high-quality coffees.

Double Fairtrade-Organic certification is found to be associated with higher producer prices but results in lower land and labour productivity, and thereby fails to increase producer income and contribute to poverty reduction.

Our assessment is built on the analysis of three different data sets, namely: 1) the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI), 2) the Swedish Database for Forest Owner Analysis, presenting data on small-scale forestry practices and certification, and 3) a follow-up mail survey addressed to private small-scale forest owners with certified forest properties. Our NFI analysis indicated some minor improvements in forest conditions, corresponding with the interim target for enhanced biological diversity (dead wood, broad-leaved trees and old forests). The improvements were less evident on large-scale forest properties (certified in accordance with the Forest Stewardship Council scheme) than on small-scale private forest properties (mainly certified in accordance with the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes). This contradicts a common assumption that a much higher degree of certification with stricter environmental standards will give more evident positive impacts on environmental conditions. However, results from the follow-up survey showed that more harvesting activity had taken place on certified small-scale forest properties than on non-certified properties. This could mean more negative effects on biodiversity. We conclude by stressing the importance of improving quantitative methods for determining a cause-and-effect relationship between certification and nature protection; previous research tends to report rather far-reaching conclusions based on limited data sets.

This study examines a relatively new program in Michigan USA, the Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program (MAEAP), and explores how it might serve to reduce nutrient pollution associated with intensive corn production. Interviews with corn farmers were used to explore reasons for program participation, the extent of management changes, and opinions regarding program effectiveness. Results indicate that most farmers enrolled in the program had already satisfied the majority of the requirements, therefore few changes were made that would result in environmental improvements. Interviews also revealed that in almost all cases, corn farmers were unable to market their products as MAEAP verified. Participation was largely driven by goals to avoid law enforcement and minor financial benefits through insurance discounts. Farmers indicated that a lack of monitoring and enforcement reduced the perceived effectiveness of the program. Most farmers favored direct payments through government conservation programs over MAEAP. This case illustrates the limitations of voluntary and market-based programs to address agri-environmental problems and supports the use of multiple policy approaches."

F."	2010	Organizing smallholder production for sustainability: lessons learned from fairtrade certification in the Tanzanian tea industry	The objective of this paper is to examine the different ways that smallholders are brought into Fairtrade certification schemes in the Tanzanian tea industry. We examine the different ownership relations of processing factories and the perceived benefits of these different arrangements. We are looking to explore the challenges and opportunities provided by each of these different ownership relations and the possibilities for sustainability. Specifically we ask: (1) Which type of ownership arrangement is more likely to engage in Fairtrade certification? (2) Do perceived benefits from Fairtrade certification increase with the percentage of ownership shares? and (3) What aspects of these organizational relations have resulted in more sustainable relationships between growers and processors? We use descriptive qualitative analysis to identify the significance between factory ownership organization and scheme success. This also allows us to discuss participants' perceptions of the benefits of each scheme. We find that there is a movement towards innovation in the organizational strategies for linking growers to tea processing factories in Tanzania. This innovation includes new ownership arrangements of processing factories and outgrower contracts that have been associated with certified Fairtrade production. We also suggest that organizational innovation is significant for obtaining scheme success yet perceived benefits of and increased information about Fairtrade production is independent from ownership shares in processing.

The reduction of emissions on an individual farm might be highly accepted by farm owners if it were accompanied by an increase in profitability. Using life cycle assessments to determine the product carbon footprints (PCF) and farm-level evaluations to record profitability, we explored opportunities for optimization based on analysis of 81 organic and conventional pasture-based dairy farms in southern Germany. The objective of the present study was to detect common determining factors for low PCF and high management incomes (MI) to achieve GHG reductions at the lowest possible operational cost. In our sample, organic farms, which performed economically better than conventional farms, produced PCF that were significantly higher than those produced by conventional farms [1.61 0.29 vs. 1.45 0.28 kg of CO2 equivalents (CO(2)eq) per kg of milk; means SD)]. A multiple linear regression analysis of the sample demonstrated that low feed demand per kilogram of milk, high grassland yield, and low forage area requirements per cow are the main factors that decrease PCF. These factors are also useful for improving a farm's profitability in principle. For organic farms, a reduction of feed demand of 100 g/kg of milk resulted in a PCF reduction of 105 g of CO(2)eq/ kg of milk and an increase in MI of approximately 2.1 euro cents (c)/kg of milk. For conventional farms, a decrease of feed demand of 100 g/kg of milk corresponded to a reduction in PCF of 117 g of CO(2)eq/kg of milk and an increase in MI of approximately 3.1 c/kg of milk. Accordingly, farmers could achieve higher profits while reducing GHG emissions. Improved education and training of farmers and consultants regarding GHG mitigation and farm profitability appear to be the best methods of improving efficiency under traditional and organic farming practices."

Defining and benchmarking EBFM strategies for these incidental environmental impacts has been challenging, and this lack of consensus has, in part, resulted in a proliferation of eco-labeling schemes with variable and vague criteria for environmental targets. The performance of fisheries certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), the most prominent eco-labeling certifier, was compared to non-certified fisheries and evaluated against target reference points for a suite of metrics derived from the EBFM literature. Specifically we compared marine mammal bycatch, finfish discard rates, and gear impacts between MSC-certified fisheries and non-certified fisheries. Discards of non-target finfish and bycatch rates of marine mammals were no different between certified and non-certified U.S. fisheries. Observer coverage was no higher in certified fisheries, and many fisheries failed to meet the coverage level thought adequate to document bycatch of protected species. MSC-certified fisheries did have lower average gear destructiveness scores than non-certified stocks when weighted by landings but not when weighted by the number of fisheries. Our analysis indicates that MSC-certified fisheries perform better on some ecosystem-based sustainability metrics but are indistinguishable from non-certified stocks on others, and improvement is needed for all certified fisheries to meet quantitative goals for the collateral impacts of fishing.

Using data obtained from interviews with farmers applying intensive horticultural systems in Damnoen Saduak District (Ratchaburi Province) we determined whether those who followed the GAP program could gain access to foreign markets to sell their produce and whether their practices were better in terms of improving food security and worker safety through adequate synthetic pesticide use compared to non-GAP farmers. The results showed that the GAP program has been beneficial for the farmers, by focusing its efforts on certification which is a necessary requirement for export access. However, pesticide management practices did not differ between GAP and non-GAP farmers. We argue that inadequate implementation of the standard in the region is due to a lack of sufficient governmental resources necessary to train farmers and to control on-farm activities that may lead to a decrease in synthetic pesticide use."

To begin to answer this question, we measured forest structure on three FSC-certified stands, three uncertified stands, and six adjacent unharvested reference stands (12 stands total) composed primarily of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) on non-industrial private properties in central Vermont, USA. The certified and uncertified partial harvests reduced total tree biomass and live tree carbon storage by one-third compared to reconstructed pre-harvest conditions. Both treatments also contained significantly lower densities of saplings and some mid-size trees compared to non-harvested references due to similar impacts from harvesting. The net present value of merchantable sugar maple over 10 year projections was consistently lower on certified than uncertified stands, but this difference was insignificant at discount rates from 4-8%. The certified stands contained significantly greater total residual volumes of coarse woody debris (standing and downed) than uncertified stands, although the debris was smaller than that found in unmanaged mature forests. Overall, our data suggest that FSC-certified harvested stands in northern hardwood forests have similar sugar maple timber value, aboveground live tree carbon storage value, similar live tree structure, and greater residual coarse woody debris than uncertified harvested stands.

The degree of compliance with biodiversity measures established in the prevailing certification standard (ISO 14001 and the Norwegian standard ""Living Forests"") was compared in a field study, and the differences were analysed. In some aspects, a clear difference could be seen, most clearly in an increasing number of green retention trees and an increasing mean width of buffer-strips left along rivers, bogs and lakes in the postcertification units compared with the precertification units. Even though there was a significant increase in the mean number of retention trees, as much as 21% of the postcertification regeneration areas still did not have sufficient retention trees to comply with the certification standard and 41% had either too few retention trees or too few spruce trees according to the standard. Concerning the management of small swamp forests, and the damage done to terrain and prelogging coarse dead wood by off-road transport, little improvement was seen. The discussion examines whether it is probable that the changes seen are a result of forest certification in Norway. Â© 2008 Taylor & Francis."

They primarily aim at enhancing the sustainability of agricultural production processes. The global palm oil supply, the different environmental and social problems related to it, and the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification clearly illustrate this. However, global sustainability standards may also have unintended impacts on food security and local development, which are not explicitly taken into account. This article explores the unnoticed effects of voluntary palm oil certification in Indonesia and Ghana and identifies their implications on local and national food provision. As voluntary labels and certification schemes are an emerging category of global governance instruments, their role in food security, as a global public good, should be taken seriously and connected to political and scientific debates on their future involvement in realizing food security.

Although there are 10 MSC-certified fisheries in Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC), this proportion is low (4%) compared to the total number of certified fisheries globally. Therefore, implementation of MSC certification in LAC fisheries is examined by considering: (1) fishing industry drivers for certification and (2) certified fisheries performance against the MSC standard. The MSC certification was suitable for large multi-national enterprises with export-oriented markets and for small-scale fisheries with exclusive access rights harvesting high-value resources. Maintaining or increasing market-share was a main motivation to pursue certification. Most LAC certified fisheries showed high performance in terms of stock status, governance and management systems. However, the expansion of the MSC certification in LAC remains limited by: (1) intrinsic weaknesses of fisheries in the region (shortage of information and instability in governance systems); and (2) high costs associated to certification and extrinsic market conditions (price shocks and demand retractions). Innovative strategies to encourage the development of domestic certified seafood markets, and a major inclusiveness of small-scale fisheries with traditional management arrangements at the local level, could constitute significant steps toward a more sustainable pathway on a regional scale.

Its Impact on Commercial and Small-Scale Producers in South Africa	"Fairtrade initially was limited to improving the lives of small-scale and peasant farmers, but later on it embraced commercial farmers, which attracted criticism. While there are a number of justifications for the Fairtrade organization's decision, there are authors who feel that meaningful ""fair trade"" cannot be achieved with the inclusion of commercial farms. This paper investigates the impact of Fairtrade on commercial farms and small-scale farmer cooperatives in South Africa. Fairtrade on South African commercial farms embraces a number of policy concerns related to land reform, BEE and sustainable development. The results of the study show that when commercial farms are included in the Fairtrade model, communities in which these farmers live benefit from developmental projects. In addition, in some instances, farm workers gain shares in the commercial farms, and benefit from the farm owners' knowledge and capital."

In Brazil, organic farming is one of the most established initiatives in this area. Therefore, it is important to subsidize the decision-making regarding policies for organic coffee production. Thereby, this study analyzed the socio-economic sustainability of this production system in relation to conventional. We applied a semi-structured questionnaire on coffee farms in the Brazilian coffee producers states and analyzed the coffee production cost structure. We identified the reasons that led the producers to organic management, implications of certification on the management, and prices received by organic coffee and the market mechanism. Results showed that there is no standard for organic coffee production and marketing in Brazil. Among the producers, there are different levels of access to technical information and the main limitation of the organic coffee chain is not the technology of production, but the difficulty of coffee marketing. Another important limitation, for medium and large farms, is the cost of manpower, mainly in areas dominated by mountain, where machines operations are not viable. Moreover, the yield of organic coffee system is generally lower than the conventional. Furthermore, soil and climatic differences lead to different regional behavior. Finally, we could conclude that the production of organic coffee can be sustainable in Brazil mainly in two structural conditions: (1) family farmers; and (2) small producers, who employ only one or two workers, preferably only in the harvest time."

This evaluation focuses on Pangasius producers in Vietnam and Bangladesh, and one of the key areas which standards seek to regulate; the environment. We conclude that certification is likely to result in greater differentiation and polarisation between larger and smaller farm operators and will increasingly act to exclude of the latter from access to Western European and North American markets, and that any local environmental gains produced may be of relatively minor significance."

Fair Trade banana production in the Dominican Republic	"In an effort to alter exploitative relations that characterize the conventional agro-food system, Fair Trade organizations are promoting an alternative system of certification and labeling for commodities such as coffee, cacao, and bananas that are grown under healthy social and environmental conditions. Labels then identify these products to conscientious consumers who are willing to pay more for them with the expectation that higher prices will deliver additional returns to producers. Yet, do these initiatives offer a real alternative and can they foster positive social change in the agro-food system? Drawing on fieldwork in the Dominican Republic, this paper addresses the implications of Fair Trade at the level of production. I focus on a case study of a certified banana producer group to suggest that production for the Fair Trade market can provide much needed material benefits, strengthen the producers' organization, and open up critical market access to Fair Trade partners. However, I also discuss important limits to the broader potential of Fair Trade initiatives for transforming trade relations. Fair Trade should not be ignored as an alternative mode of production or trade but, rather, a better understanding of how they are experienced by producers can help address the limits of the initiatives."

In the Congo Basin rainforests, integration of timber and non-timber forest resources plays a key role in the subsistence and market economies of rural communities. This is however mainly occurring in "" ordinary"" forest lands and not in formally gazetted forest lands. In this paper we briefly explore the major land-uses in the Congo Basin and their actual or potential for multiple-use. We then focus on the most extant production system (industrial logging concessions) and analyze the existing issues and options for managing actively both timber and biodiversity with a special emphasis on wildlife and the role of certification. A few promising but yet 'unfinished' examples do exist in the region and we review these cases to draw lessons and recommendations. We contend however that true multiple-use could only be realized by expanding beyond boundaries of formal management units through new innovative land-use units, allowing a spatial cohabitation of the interests of local people, of conservation proponents and of extractive industries in the same management unit.

R."	1997	Soil quality characteristics during conversion to organic orchard management	"Soil quality measurements were made as part of a larger study of conversion to certified organic management in a California apple orchard, and results are reported here. The general objectives of the soil research were: (1) to compare soil properties between the two production systems (conventional and transitional organic); (2) relate observed differences to soil processes and management practices; and (3) determine the relative usefulness of each of the measured parameters as soil quality indicators. Bulk density and water holding capacity were useful indicators of changes in soil physical characteristics. Because treatment differences in bulk density were detected, biological and chemical data were expressed volumetrically to more closely approximate in-field values. EC, Ca, and Mg readings were used as an indication of the absence of significant salinity problems in both production systems. Soil pH in surface soils was mildly acidic, and values were slightly higher in the organic production system plots. Potentially mineralizable nitrogen and biomass carbon (C) were more sensitive indicators of system change than total N or organic C. Because microbial respiration was higher from organic plots on some sample dates. C loss via CO2 was evaluated against C inputs in the two systems. It was concluded that in both production systems, C inputs appear to outweigh C loss via microbial respiration, and therefore the potential for net organic matter loss is minimal. No significant treatment differences were seen in the respiratory ratio, or in the ratio of biomass C to total organic C. Increased colonization by mycorrhizal fungi seemed to provide an explanation for higher tissue P levels in the organic trees, and thus was an indicator of increased soil biological function in the organically managed plots. Soil invertebrates did not seem to be sensitive indicators of short-term responses to management changes in the current study, as no significant differences were seen during 1990-1991, the first 2 years of transition to organic management in the organic treatment plots. However, earthworm abundance and biomass increased significantly during 1992 in the organic plots, and seemed to provide an indication of long-term response to changes in weed, pest, and soil fertility management. Pitfall trap arthropods were too variable in abundance and diversity to discern any significant treatment effects with the sampling scheme used, and therefore these parameters were not useful indicators of soil quality changes.

In Poland, relatively limited research has been conducted on soil quality and fertility in organic, dynamically developing agricultural systems. A comparative study on soil parameters under organic and conventional cultivation was performed in 2009. Twenty-two pairs (organic-conventional) of fields located in the south and east of Poland were chosen. All organic sites were certified. The following field crops were investigated: apple, pear, blackcurrant, carrot, beetroot, and celery. The soil granulometric composition, total organic content, total nitrogen, as well as the content of available macroelements (P, K, Ca, Mg, S), microelements (Cu, Fe, Zn, Mn, B), and trace elements (Cd and Pb) were measured. The organic farm soils had a higher level of the total organic matter (2.02%) than the conventional (1.75%). The organic system increased the total soil N level in celery and beetroot fields. Low or very low concentrations of available P in organically managed orchards were observed in individual farms, whereas excessive soil P amounts were noted for organic beetroot and celery fields. Differences in soil K concentration caused by the farming system were found only for red beet. Ca concentration was higher in the conventional than in the organic soil only for celery. There was a higher soil available Cu concentration for all of the investigated conventional vegetable fields than for the organic. The reverse was true for the apple and blackcurrant farms. The highest levels of Cd and Pb were noted in soils sampled from some organic celery fields. Â© 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

The first chapter includes an introduction and concentrates on three fields of enquiry: how certification has impacted on community forestry and community forestry enterprise; how certification has helped improve responsible business practice in industrial forest product supply chains; and how certification has contributed the kinds of policy processes that lead to sustainable forest management. Chapter 2 presents a synthesis of case studies of certified community-based enterprises in Bolivia, Mexico, Papua New Guinea and Zambia, which are field assessments of the social, economic and environmental impacts of market-based certification. It highlights the main lessons and trends to emerge from the case studies, supplemented by analysis of additional literature and relevant experiences, and analyses stakeholder motivation for certification, the challenges and outcomes of certification. Chapter 3 looks at how certification has worked as a market-based tool in practice, examining mechanisms by which market demands for certified products translate into decisions by forest managers to certify. The last chapter on the other hand discusses the applications of certification categorized into three groups: market-oriented certification of forest products or forest environmental services; regulation-oriented verification to strengthen or complement forest law enforcement; and project- or institutional-oriented certification to verify that particular forestry goals or outcomes have been achieved."

On the other hand certification has not reduced the share of clear-cut free forestry or increased the preference for mixed stands, as hoped by many stakeholders."

Organic coffee in Costa Rica	"Eco-certification of coffee, timber and other high-value agricultural commodities is increasingly widespread. In principle, it can improve commodity producers' environmental performance, even in countries where state regulation is weak. But eco-certification will have limited environmental benefits if, as one would expect, it disproportionately selects for producers already meeting certification standards. Rigorous evaluations of the environmental effects of eco-certification in developing countries that control for selection bias are virtually nonexistent. To help fill this gap, we use detailed farm-level data to analyze the environmental impacts of organic coffee certification in central Costa Rica. We use propensity score matching to control for selection bias. We find that organic certification improves coffee growers' environmental performance. It significantly reduces chemical input use and increases adoption of some environmentally friendly management practices. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V."

Using survey data, this study analyse the main factors motivating companies operating in the Italian forest based industry to implement FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) standard, as a tool to promote responsible forest management and traceability of derived products, and the impact of this standard on the economic and organisational results. The findings provide evidences that signalling mechanisms drive the entrepreneurs towards the adoption of FSC certification, followed by moral and ethical reasons. In terms of impact, emerges that companies are compared to higher operation costs necessary to obtain the certification of compliance with the scheme requirements, that are only partially compensated, not by an increase in the selling price of certified products, but by the company's ability to establish new business relationships with a consequent increase in the sales.

Owned and managed by the Chiquitano Indians, the Lomerio project secured forest management certification from the Rainforest Alliance's Smart Wood programme in February 1996. In doing so it became the first forest enterprise to be certified in Bolivia. The process of certification is described. The analysis of the impacts of certification at Lomerio is divided into 5 parts covering: forest management practices; enterprise administration, finances and marketing; institutions and social relations; distribution of costs and benefits; and national forest policy and legislation. Under each of these, an attempt is made to assess both the direct and indirect impacts of certification. In the case of national policy and legislation, the analysis concentrates on the project's legal standing following certification, as well as more general developments in Bolivian forest policy and legislation related to forest certification.

Partisans promote ATOs as systems to transfer benefits from consumers in the wealthy northern hemisphere to producers in the poor southern hemisphere. The central public policy question is whether the well-being of poor agricultural producers in the southern hemisphere is actually being improved by fair-trade practices, or are consumers who buy products on this premise deceived? The research reported here partially answers the question whether participation in a fair-trade coffee marketing channel delivers benefits to small-scale producers in Latin America. The authors employ a survey methodology to compare TransFair USA (TF) cooperative participants and nonparticipating farmers in three countries on socioeconomic indicators of well-being. According to the analysis, the economic effects of fair-trade participation are unassailable; the effects on educational and health outcomes are uneven. However, TF cooperative participation positively affects educational attainment and the likelihood that a child is currently studying.

Indeed, U.S. producers are increasingly interested in whether they should become certified. However, the economic and market implications, as well as the current nature and status of certified wood markets in the United States, are not well understood. A review indicates that producers face both direct and indirect costs associated with adoption. These costs are expected to be covered by increased product prices, or the 'green' premium. The overall impact on market equilibrium though is uncertain. For example, widespread certification could force marginal forest land to go out of commercial production. Current production of certified wood in the United States is limited to four major producers. Although the market for certified wood is distributed throughout the United States, merchants of certified products are located primarily on the west coast. Sawn wood, flooring, S2S lumber, and wholesale furniture are the most popular items."

Many recent studies compare these two fundamentally different systems for soil properties, in different regions of the world. In this study, two adjacent fields in Central Italy, one managed according to organic, and the other according to conventional farming methods, were studied to determine the effects of these two agricultural systems on soil quality indicators at the farm level. Chemical and microbiological properties were chosen as indicators of soil quality and were measured at soil depth intervals of 5-20 and 20-35 cm, after 7 years of organic certified and conventional management methods. The field under organic management showed significantly better soil nutritional and microbiological conditions; with increased level of total nitrogen, nitrate and available phosphorus, and an increased microbial biomass content, and enzymatic activities (acid phosphatase, protease and dehydrogenase). No consistent increase in total organic carbon was observed. Results of the study suggest that, over the period of 7 year, organic management method strongly affects soil quality indicators. Large differences between the two soils were found in terms of microbiological properties, which are sensitive soil indicators of changes occurred under the different farming systems.

The changes, developed and planned by students, staff and faculty in 2007, were implemented in 2008-2009 and fully in place by 2010. The plan required a reduction in livestock herd sizes, creating less dependence on purchased off-farm inputs, such as livestock feedstuffs and fertilizers for growing animal feed-crops. Third-party certifications, including USDA Certified Organic and Animal Welfare Approved, facilitated access to price premiums and new markets. Selling more meat and fewer live animals resulted in financial gains for the livestock enterprises, but the greatest returns were generated through organic horticultural production. Questions remain about the environmental, social, and animal-welfare trade-offs from the transition, but it clearly resulted in financial improvements and reduced dependence on off-farm inputs.

All firms improved many practices in forest management, environmental protection, community relations, public affairs, economic, and environmental management systems in order to receive certification, with an average of 27 changes reported per firm that received forest certification. The amount of changes were fairly evenly distributed among forest management practices, social and legal aspects, and economic and system impacts. Most firms certified by FSC received several conditions or corrective action requests, but these represented only about one-third of the 27 changes those firms made to receive or maintain certification. Certification appeared to prompt similar changes in Argentina and Chile, and with FSC and CERTFOR. Certified firms usually hired only one or two new employees for certification, but did shift job responsibilities so that about 5% to 10% of personnel time was spent on certification. Individuals at interviewed firms were generally very satisfied with certification and all firms except one intended to re-certify.

This research compares environmental and socioeconomic benefits of Brazil nut certification for 231 producers in 17 communities in the trinational border region of Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru during the 2006-2007 harvest. Specific objectives were: (1) to analyze differences in ""best management practices"" between certified and noncertified producers; (2) to identify socioeconomic benefits associated with certified nuts; and (3) to explore producer perceptions of nut certification. Organic and Fairtrade certification were associated with better postharvest practices and higher prices, while Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification was related to preharvest planning. Certification was viewed most positively in Bolivia, where producers gleaned financial and social benefits, moderately in Peru, and least positively in Brazil, where benefits were lower or nonexistent.

We developed a model to quantify effects of different management practices in plantations and mills producing Crude-Palm-Oil (CPO) - including non-RSPO, potential RSPO, and RSPO certified producers. Our study shows that five activities contribute most to environmental impacts of CPO production; 1) burning fibers in boilers,2) use of fertilizers, 3) wastewater treatment and empty-fruit-bunch disposal, 4) gasoline use in weed cutters and 5) glyphosate use for weed control. Together these activities cause environmental impacts associated with global warming, ozone formation, acidification, and human toxicity problems. RSPO certified producers cause the lowest environmental impacts due to better waste management such as biogas production from wastewater. We found that environmental performance of the most environmental friendly mills considerably exceeds the RSPO standards, which may be related to the interventions of an environmental project in the Tapi basin. Currently, only 11% of CPO in the Tapi River basin is produced by RSPO certified mills, and non-CPO certified mills produce around 60% of CPO. Most of environmental impacts of palm oil production in the basin are therefore caused by non-RSPO certified palm oil mills. We explored two alternative scenarios illustrating that if more mills in the basin would adopt best-practice CPO production processes in line with those group named ""RSPO certified"", environmental impacts generated in the basin will be considerably lower.

This article examines the role of fair trade in stabilizing prices for small coffee producers, and compares the prices all along the supply chain of the instant coffees (Nestle and Cafedirect). Although Cafedirect's price guarantee has prevented producers from going bankrupt, it is clear that the processing and retail side has become more expensive since the 1990s, partly as a result of the small volumes traded. Cafedirect's high prices compared with commercial brands are likely to ensure that it remains small, and therefore only benefits a minority of producers. The authors examine the options for Nicaragua's small coffee producers and recommend that the producers upgrade their production and postharvest technologies to produce high-quality specialty coffees which can command high prices even without a fair trade tag. They also recommend that the cooperatives be strengthened to be less inefficient and more accountable to their membership."

Statistical results show that net coffee income per hectare is positively influenced by certification participation. Furthermore, education status the household head, number of members involved in coffee cultivation, distance from household to town center, and training availability effect significantly on net coffee income. Moreover, four matching algorithms of PSM highlighted that members of the certified cooperative achieve higher net coffee income per hectare compared to non-certified ones.

T. N.; Hoshino, S.; Hashimoto, S."	2014	Forest stewardship council certificate for a group of planters in Vietnam: SWOT analysis and implications	"A group of smallholders in Vietnam has obtained Forest Stewardship Council certification (FSC) for their Acacia plantation forest. Although the certification aims to improve livelihoods via economic, social, and environmental benefits, there are concerns amongst smallholders regarding the outcomes from their certification decision as well as difficulties in maintaining the certification. This article assesses the benefits and challenges of forest management certification from the perspective of small household groups who have achieved FSC certification. The FSC has brought new opportunities for farmers, such as increased selling price and extended trade networks, but is also associated with significant obstacles such as high initial and annual surveillance audit fees, difficult paper work, and complicated procedures for selling wood. Additionally, the small size of the plantations and low expertise in forest management make it more difficult and costly for farmers to achieve certification. There is a heavy dependency on donors for financial and technical support. Because subsidies from organizations like the World Wide Fund for Nature Vietnam are unlikely to continue indefinitely, the benefit of certification for smallholders is uncertain. Feasible actions to increase the sustainability of the group are suggested, including increasing the responsibility of the group members, enhancing the awareness and capacity of the local people, and searching for additional support from other organizations and wood processing companies. From the macro level, a national forest stewardship council should be established so that the audit cost for certification would be reduced. Â© 2014, The Japanese Forest Society and Springer Japan."

This paper presents an analysis of GlobalGAP adoption by small-scale fruit and vegetable farmers in Thailand focusing on GlobalGAP group certification, the costs and perceived benefits of GlobalGAP adoption, and the factors influencing standard adoption. In our research area, GlobalGAP group certification has encouraged the formation of new institutional arrangements between farmers, exporters and donors. Farmers participating in a development program were organized in certification groups where the Quality Management System (QMS) was either run by the donor, by the exporter, or by farmers themselves. Results of our adoption model suggest that support by donors, exporters and public-private partnerships are vital to enable small-scale farmers to adopt the standard. Furthermore, farmers are more likely to adopt if they are better educated and more experienced, and if they have access to female family labor, improved farming technology, and information and extension services."

Assessment of mammal diversity in Chiapas, Mexico"	"Biodiversity-friendly coffee certifications offer a viable way to protect wildlife habitat while providing a financial incentive to farmers. Most studies related to these certifications focus on avian habitat requirements and it is not known whether these standards also apply to other wildlife, such as mammals, that inhabit the coffee landscapes. We assessed the non-volant mammalian fauna and their associated habitat requirements in 23 sites representing forest, Bird FriendlyÂ¨ shade, conventional shade, and sun coffee habitats. We used Sherman trap-grids to measure small mammal abundance and richness, while camera traps were set for medium-sized and large mammals. We detected 17 species of mammals, representing 11 families. This preliminary study indicates that coffee farms in this region provide an important refuge for mammalian wildlife. Mammal species density ranked significantly higher in Bird FriendlyÂ¨ coffee sites than other coffee habitats, although there was no significant difference for species richness (using Chao2 estimator) among the habitat types. No significant difference was found in small mammal abundance among the habitat types. We found a higher species density of medium and large mammals in sites with larger, more mature shade trees associated with, but not required by Bird FriendlyÂ¨ certification standards. However, lower strata vegetation (5 cm to 1 m tall), the only vegetation parameter found to increase abundance and density for small mammals, is not specified in the Bird FriendlyÂ¨ standards. Our findings suggest that although the standards devised for avian habitat do benefit mammals, further study is needed on the requirements specific for mammals that could be included to enhance the coffee habitat for mammals that inhabit these coffee landscapes."

The comparison to non-certified Acacia plantation shows that the management of certified forests does not increase the cost at high level, while the income of selling FSC wood logs is very promising. However, since currently the certification is subsidized and stumpage price is kept at higher than normal to foster the participation of local people the current price premium should be treated with caution. As for sustainable development, local people need to manage the certification by themselves which then, required them to have a good financial plan to cover the necessary fee.

However, it is not known whether RSPO-certified plantations are effective in maintaining biodiversity. Focusing on Peninsular Malaysia, we show that both RSPO-certified plantations and uncertified large-scale plantations are characterized by very low levels of landscape heterogeneity. By contrast, heterogeneity measures were many times higher in palm oil producing smallholdings, despite their lack of RSPO certification. The low heterogeneity of large-scale oil palm plantations, including those certified by the RSPO, is likely to severely limit their value for biodiversity conservation. Uncertified smallholdings, in contrast, are much more heterogeneous and therefore hold substantially greater promise for the integration of palm oil production and biodiversity conservation than large-scale plantations. With oil palm agriculture further expanding, certification schemes should mandate producers to improve biodiversity conservation through landscape management that promotes greater landscape heterogeneity.

However, these products are valuable for their positive impact on the economy, quality of life and food security on the sectors involved in production. Objectives: To determine the effect of certification on food security and safety in day laborers households at the Southwest of Antioquia. Methods: We selected 79 households of resident day laborers (41 from certified farms and 38 from non-certified) for comparative analysis. Samples of drinks (juice) in everyday use were collected for analysis by counting the most probable number (MPN) of total (TC) and fecal coliforms (FC), using the technique of Fluorocult LMX (MerckÂ¨, USA). It was applied the Latin American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (ELCSA) and a survey to assess the availability and access to food, economy, education, housing quality and nutritional status by the Body Mass Index (BMI). After identifying the variables that best represented the components of household food security, we performed an analysis of MDS (Multidimensional Scaling) to find associations between food security components and ELCSA levels. Results: No significant differences were found in food security in the ELCSA, by type of farm. The certified farms had a tendency to be associated to low TC contamination, low incomes and higher food and housing costs. The MDS showed that acceptable quality in total coliform was more associated to certification than to other variables, and FC contamination to mild insecurity. Conclusions: The certification in coffee farms is not significantly associated with household food security of day laborers working in such sites. Meanwhile, CF contamination can be considered as an indicator of mild food insecurity."

In September 2008, the MSC first certified the Kyoto Danish Seine Fishery Federation (KDSFF) as a sustainable fishery in Asia. In order to examine any impact of MSC certification on the KDSFF, this study examines structural changes in the market. Since no immediate impact of price premium changes can be realized, structural break tests and cointegration tests are conducted. The monthly ex-vessel price of flathead flounder in the Kyoto market is compared with those in the two adjacent uncertified markets. The structural break tests detected a significant impact two months after the KDSFFÃ•s certification. The cointegration and Granger causality tests showed that the Kyoto market was previously influenced by other larger markets, but has become less subject to their influence after introduction of MSC certification."

This paper examines the effect of Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification on ex-vessel prices from three different fisheries: salmon and halibut in Alaska, and flathead flounder in Kyoto, Japan. A difference-in-difference approach (DiD) is used to estimate whether the relationship between ex-vessel prices of MSC-certified fisheries and market-competing non-certified fisheries have statistically changed after certification. Mixed results show that after certification significant increases occurred in the differences between ex-vessel prices for certified chum and pink salmon and flathead flounder relative to their uncertified counterparts, while the price difference declined between certified and uncertified sockeye salmon experienced significant negative effects. No significant effects were found for chinook and coho salmon and halibut. Results may be attributable to MSC certification or other unobservable variables influencing the certified fishery relative to the uncertified fishery. This paper adds to the literature on market and environmental effects of fisheries certification, which in aggregate continues to show ambiguous results across a landscape of fisheries globally.

F."	2013	Responding to globalization: impacts of certification on Colombian small-scale coffee growers	"Eco-certification of food and other agricultural products has been promoted as a way of making markets work for sustainability. Certification programs offer a price premium to producers who invest in more sustainable practices. The literature on the impacts of certification has focused primarily on the economic benefits farmers perceive from participating in these schemes. These benefits, however, are often subject to price variability, offering only a partial explanation of why farmers join and stay in certification programs. We evaluated the potential of the Rainforest Alliance certification program to foster more resilient social-ecological systems in the face of globalization. Using the case of Santander, Colombia, and a pair-based comparison of 86 households to effectively produce a robust counterfactual, we showed that certification provides important environmental benefits, while improving the well-being of farmers and their communities. Furthermore, the study showed that price premiums are only one of many elements defining the success of certification, particularly important for motivating farmers to join, but less so to explain retention and upgrading. The case of Colombian coffee growers illustrates how the connections between local social-ecological systems and larger global forces can produce more sustainable livelihoods and land uses."

F."	2014	Eco-certification and coffee cultivation enhance tree cover and forest connectivity in the Colombian coffee landscapes	"Eco-certification of agricultural commodities offers an appealing option to promote more sustainable practices among smallholders, increase agricultural value, and lift farmers out of poverty through better market access. This study evaluates whether coffee cultivation is associated with changes in forest cover and forest fragmentation and whether the Rainforest Alliance eco-certification program has led to enhanced tree cover and greater landscape connectivity in the Colombian eastern Andes. Based on satellite imagery, geo-referenced coffee parcels and a pair_case comparison, we show that coffee-growing regions have larger areas in forest, larger forest patches, and better connectivity among patches than non-coffee areas. These differences, however, do not seem to be accentuated over time, except for dense forest cover in the coffee-growing region. The latter has increased since the introduction of a certification program that requires protection of forest remnants and riparian vegetation. Moreover, certified farms in the study area have increased the amount of tree cover on their plots significantly more than non-certified ones. Our study design, therefore, detects additionality in the impact of certification on tree cover increase: in a region with overall increase in tree cover, certified farms contributed significantly more to that trend than non-certified farms. This study presents the first evaluation of the impacts of certification in cultivated landscapes at the ecosystem level, detectable by Earth observation satellites.

Results showed that the longer one company remained in one place, the deeper social relations with the neighbouring population became. This in itself is conducive to an environment in which there is less conflict between the local population and logging companies. However, it is usually only after companies decided to pursue certification that several practical social improvements occurred. In particular, in certified FMUs, this study found better working and living conditions for workers and their families; more inclusive and better governed institutions for negotiations between the local population and logging companies, except with regard to conflict-resolution mechanisms; better managed and more effective benefit-sharing mechanisms; and innovative ways of dealing with problems related to infringement of customary uses. The complex historical and political-economic reality in which certification has developed in the Congo basin might well make issues of attribution and causality difficult to clarify. Further, results help establish a clear boundary that currently exists between certified and non-certified timber. The former is sourced in FMUs that implement not only legally mandated social standards but also voluntarily adopted ones that are superior and more effective. There should of course be no complacency from the FSC or logging companies with certified FMUs in comparing themselves with the 'bottom,' as the logic of the FSC is to reward more responsible forest managers who are assessed against ever-evolving standards, irrespective of the quality of national legislation. However, one should also not forget that companies with certified FMUs in the study countries are competing less against a theoretical global logging company than against their neighbours, who daily produce the same species and sell on similar markets, albeit with much lower investments, especially those targeted to improve social performance. In this very competitive and uneven playing field, and with the scarce price premiums obtained so far, the evidence presented indicates that certification in the Congo basin has been able to push companies toward remarkable social progress."

"Agricultural produce certification is synonymous to farm assurance of which cocoa certification is an example; dealing with issues of Good Agricultural, Environmental and Social Practices (GAP, GEP and GSP) in cocoa production. Essentially, GAP, GEP and GSP packages had in-built mechanism that can aid farmers mitigate factors that could lead to farm income risks in cocoa production. Consequently, this study examined the influence of cocoa certification on income risks of cocoa farming households in South-west Nigeria. A multistage sampling technique was used to select 180 cocoa farming households from whose heads data were obtained with interview schedule in Southwest Nigeria. Data were analyzed with Chi-square Statistic, Income Risk Management Diversification Index (IRD) and Mann-Whitney-U Test Statistic. Chi-square analysis shows that (52.3%) certified cocoa farming households employed more risk management strategies than (94.2%) uncertified cocoa farming households (p<0.01). The Mann-Whitney-U test revealed a significant difference (p>0.05) between the income risk management practices of certified and uncertified cocoa farming households. Therefore, produce certification has been helping cocoa farming households in mitigating farm income risk in cocoa production through the employment of diverse (risk) management strategies. Hence, stakeholders should intensify efforts in encouraging farming households to embrace (cocoa) produce certification."	Applied Studies in Agribusiness and Commerce 9: 75-79.

"Organic farming systems differ fundamentally from conventional ones in their primary focus on management practices that promote and enhance ecological harmony. Organic farmers also tend to have a different socioeconomic profile. In this study, average socioeconomic characteristics and production practices of a national sample of about 300 certified organic vegetable growers from 14 states in USA are summarized and compared to a sample of about 6900 conventional vegetable growers. Specific materials used by organic growers for pest and nutrient management are described. Organic vegetable growers tend to be younger, more educated, less experienced in farming, and less likely to have grown up on a farm than conventional vegetable growers, and tend to operate smaller farms. Over three-quarters of the organic vegetable growers surveyed had small operations (<10 acres) and worked fewer days in off-farm jobs than conventional small growers. In contrast to conventional marketing practices, nearly half the surveyed organic growers, and the majority of small ones, marketed their vegetables directly to consumers through farmers' markets and other direct marketing channels. Organic growers relied primarily on traditional organic processes such as green manuring (legumes), animal manuring, composting and crop rotation to supply crop nutrients, and on cultural and biological tools, including pest-resistant plant cultivars, water management techniques, adjustment of planting and harvesting dates and beneficial organisms, for pest management. Animal meal, fish products and lime were the most frequently reported supplemental nutrient sources (14, 20 and 28%, respectively, used these materials). Pyrellin EC and petroleum-based soaps were the most frequently reported supplemental pest management materials (used by 6 and 8%, respectively). The pest and nutrient materials used by organic growers were generally consistent with current guidelines of major certification organizations that provide services to organic growers. There was high consistency among those guidelines and national recommendations for most of these materials."	American Journal of Alternative Agriculture 13: 69-78.

"We investigate the price premium on certified wood from sustainable forests, using data from more than 38,000 log transactions in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. We found a positive and statistically significant effect of certification. The premium added by certification was 1.4% more than the price of conventional logs. This was well in the lower range of additional willingness to pay found in previous studies that used stated preference techniques. The effect of certification varies by wood species. The premium for cedar is 4.0%, while that for cypress is statistically insignificant. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

"The Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) was introduced as a mandatory sustainability standard for large oil palm producers in 2011. While these standards are voluntary for smallholder farmers, some of their crop management practices may converge with ISPO principles. Hence, this study investigates oil palm practices among smallholder farmers in Merangin district in Jambi province, Sumatra. We draw upon a three-year panel data set of 233 oil palm smallholder farmers. We assess the factors that explain the use of these practices first by means of a bivariate probit model for a sequence of practices defined as implementation thresholds. Second we apply a count model to examine the intensity of ISPO practices. Results show that the use of ISPO-type crop management practices is not widespread among oil palm smallholders. Sixty per cent of the farmers used four practices, and this share drops to 40 per cent for six practices. Among the factors that determine the use of practices were household characteristics, economic shocks and farmers' perceived risk of diminishing oil palm productivity. This study provides a basis for developing an extension strategy of introducing ISPO practices for oil palm smallholders."	"Journal of Southeast Asian Economies, 33, 291-316.

"	2012	" Private standards, trade and poverty: GlobalGAP and horticultural employment in Senegal."	"There is a growing body of literature that analyses the implications of private food standards for developing countries. Most of this literature has focused on the trade effects of standards and on the effects on exporters and producers. Very few studies have looked at the effect of standards for workers in export supply chains - although this is important for poverty reduction. In this paper, we use original panel data from surveys among workers in the horticultural export industry in Senegal to analyse the effects of GlobalGAP certification of exporter-producer companies on the employment conditions of workers in these companies. The results suggest that GlobalGAP certification is associated with an increase in workers' daily wages and with longer employment periods. We put forward different explanations for the mechanism through which these effects on employment conditions can emerge. "	"The World Economy.

L., Goldman, P., Bryer, J., Nieto, D."	2007	"Six-year comparison between organic, IPM and conventional cotton production systems in the Northern San Joaquin Valley, California"	"Three different cotton production strategies [certified organic, conventionally grown, and reduced insecticide input/integrated pest management (IPM)] were compared in field-sized replicates in the Northern San Joaquin Valley (NSJV),California, from 1996 to 2001. We measured arthropod abundance, plant development, plant density, pesticide use, cost of production, lint quality and yields in the three treatments. Overall pest abundance was low, and a key cotton fruit pest,Lygus hesperus Knight, known as the western tarnished plant bug (WTPB), did not exceed action thresholds in any treatment. Organic fields had significantly more generalist insect predators than conventional fields during at least one seasonalinterval in all but one year. While there were no significant differences in plant development, plant densities at harvest were lower in organic than conventional and IPM fields. Some measures of lint quality (color grade and bale leaf rating) werealso lower in the organic treatment than in either the IPM or the conventional treatments. Synthetic insecticides, not allowed for use in organic production, were also used in significantly lower quantities in the IPM fields than in the conventionalfields. Over the 6-year period of the study, IPM fields averaged 0.63 kg of active ingredient (AI) insecticide per hectare, as opposed to 1.02 kg AI ha-1 for conventional fields, a reduction of 38%. Costs of production per bale were on average 37%higher for organic than for conventional cotton. This cost differential was primarily due to greater hand-weeding costs and significantly lower yields in organic cotton, compared with either IPM or conventional cotton. Average 6-year yields were4.4, 5.4 and 6.7 bales ha-1 for  organic, IPM and conventional treatments, respectively. Low world cotton prices and the lack of premium prices for organic cotton are the primary obstacles for continued production in the NSJV."

"Fair trade promises to transform small-scale coffee farming by ensuring a fair price to producers, improving market access for small producers, and creating closer ties between producers and consumers. However, as the fair-trade market has grown from a small social movement to a substantial niche market, the relationships between producers and consumers have become less personal and the market more demanding of producers. By examining the experience of COOPABUENA, a coffee cooperative in southern Costa Rica, the ways in which these changes have discouraged producers can be seen. Here, fair trade has never become more than a small outlet for higher-priced coffee, whereas other alternate markets and institutions play the role of increasing small-producer incomes, helping to develop sustainable agricultural systems, and building links between Costa Rican producers and U.S. customers. For at least some producers, fair trade has failed to carry out its promise. "	Culture & Agriculture 29 (2):89-99.

"	"Despite documented challenges, many community-based forestry (CBF) initiatives pursue forest certification. This study asked community-based forestry practitioners in Vermont what influenced their decisions to seek or not seek certification and what outcomes were realized from certification. Relationships, public image, value alignment and feedback on management practices were most commonly cited as both motivations for and results of certification. Expectations for economic benefits were low and price premiums for products were only occasionally realized. Informants complained of the increasing cost, complexity and time commitment required of certification. Overall, however, certified CBF informants felt certification was worth the expense. Group certificates and external funding significantly reduced certification costs to grassroots CBF initiatives. This study highlights the importance of facilitating organizations that can provide outreach, secure funding, understand the rules, handle documentation and develop markets for certified products.
